# GitHub Copilot Cookbook

A collection of practical recipes and examples for working with GitHub Copilot tools and features. Each recipe provides focused, copy-paste-ready code snippets and real-world examples to help you accomplish common tasks.

## What's in the Cookbook

The cookbook is organized by tool or product, with recipes collected by language where applicable:

### GitHub Copilot SDK

Ready-to-use recipes for building with the GitHub Copilot SDK across multiple languages.

- **[Copilot SDK Cookbook](copilot-sdk/)** - Recipes for .NET, Go, Node.js, and Python
  - Error handling, session management, file operations, and more
  - Runnable examples for each language
  - Best practices and complete implementation guides

## Getting Started

1. Browse the tool or product folder that matches what you want to build
2. Find the recipe that solves your use case
3. Copy the code snippet or check the `recipe/` subfolder for complete, runnable examples
4. Refer to the language-specific documentation for setup and execution instructions

## Planned Expansions

The cookbook is designed to grow alongside the GitHub Copilot ecosystem. Future additions may include recipes for:

- Additional Copilot tools and integrations
- Advanced patterns and workflows
- Integration with external services and APIs
- Language-specific optimizations and best practices
