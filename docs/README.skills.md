# 🎯 Agent Skills

Agent Skills are self-contained folders with instructions and bundled resources that enhance AI capabilities for specialized tasks. Based on the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), each skill contains a `SKILL.md` file with detailed instructions that agents load on-demand.

Skills differ from other primitives by supporting bundled assets (scripts, code samples, reference data) that agents can utilize when performing specialized tasks.
